### 🌱 What drives me?

When asked about my purpose, I have one answer: **Learn** — constantly and intentionally.
For me, learning goes beyond classrooms. It comes from solving real-world problems, building things from scratch, and sharing what I discover. As Martin Uzochukwu Ugwu said:

> *“Knowledge is power. Sharing knowledge is the key to unlocking that power.”*

This belief fuels everything I do — from writing code to analyzing data to building products that help others learn and grow.

### 💡 Why Computer Science + Data Analytics?

Computer Science is how we create tools that **expand human potential**.
Data Analytics is how we extract **insight and truth** from the world around us.

Together, they let me explore, explain, and improve. Whether it’s a fraud detection model, an investment risk dashboard, or an AI-powered mentor-matching platform — I’m drawn to work that solves real problems and makes knowledge more accessible.

### 🚀 What I'm working on

* Building **interactive data apps** that simplify decision-making
* Exploring **ML models** for risk, ranking, and pattern recognition
* Designing dashboards and tools with **real user focus** (like [my latest Bollywood Music dashboard]())
* Collaborating at **hackathons**, learning from every experience
